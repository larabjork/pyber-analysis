# Pyber Analysis
Data Bootcamp Challenge, Week 5

## Project Overview
This task involves examining ride-sharing data for three different types of cities, based on size: urban, suburban, and rural. Data are summarized in a Pandas DataFrame (tabular format) and then total weekly fares are plotted with Matplotlib in a multiple-line graph. This report summarizes differences among the city types that became apparent when examining the data, with the goal of informing decision-making at the parent company, Pyber.

## Results

A summary of the data is shown below.



### Total Rides by City Type
The number of rides appears to correlate with city type and therefore population size. The number of suburban rides is 5 times greater than the number of rural rides, and the number of urban rides is 2.6 times greater than the number of suburban rides and 13 times greater than the number of rural rides.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
## Summary

Despite Pyber's commitment to transportation equity, the disparities among the city types are strong. To ameliorate these disparities, Pyber has several options to consider:
