# Pyber Analysis
Data Bootcamp Challenge, Week 5

## Project Overview
This task involves examining ride-sharing data for three different types of cities, based on size: urban, suburban, and rural. Data are summarized in a Pandas DataFrame (tabular format) and then total weekly fares are plotted with Matplotlib in a multiple-line graph. This report summarizes differences among the city types that became apparent when examining the data, with the goal of informing decision-making at the parent company, Pyber.

## Results

### Total Rides by City Type

### Total Drivers by City Type

### Total Fares ???

### Average Fare per Ride by City Type

### Total Fares by City Type
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
